This project used the simmer package in R to build a discrete event simulation of an outpatient department. Patients followed a defined trajectory consisting of nurse consultation, doctor consultation, and pharmacy service, with each step requiring a resource and a stochastic service time. The model simulated patient arrivals and resource interactions over a 600-minute period. A total of 10,000 simulation runs were executed to capture system variability. The simulations summarised system performance by analysing resource utilisation and usage, queue lengths, patient waiting times, and activity times across all replications. Results were visualised using simmer.plot, ggplot2, and gridExtra to assess bottlenecks and overall service efficiency.
